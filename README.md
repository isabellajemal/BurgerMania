# Burger Mania

 In Burger Mania, the player is in charge of a chaotic kitchen where
they must complete cooking multiple recipes correctly and as quickly as possible. As the chef, the player will chop
ingredients, cook dishes, and assemble orders to serve hungry customers. They must prepare
multiple orders at once, juggle ingredients, and deliver orders to customers in an orderly fashion. With each dish you correctly serve to customers, you will earn one gold star on your final score.

## Important Note
Move to the left side of the kitchen to chop and the right side of the kitchen to cook your ingredients. In the middle  (where the plates are) is where you will serve your meal to the customer.
