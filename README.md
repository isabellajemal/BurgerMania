# Burger Mania

Description: In Cooking Fever, the player will be placed in charge of a chaotic kitchen where
they must complete cooking multiple recipes under a time limit. As the chef, the player will chop
ingredients, cook dishes, and assemble orders to serve hungry customers. They must prepare
multiple orders at once, juggle ingredients, and deliver orders to customers all under a time limi
to win the game. The faster and more accurately the player delivers dishes, the higher their
score will increase

## Important Note
Move to the left side of the kitchen to chop and the right side of the kitchen to cook your ingredients. In the middle(where the plates are) is where you will serve your meal.

Win Condition: Successfully serve a set number of correct orders within the time limit.
Lose Condition: The time runs out and the player has not completed enough orders, or three
incorrect orders
